  We are a grassroots organization dedicated to the support of safe and secure abortion access in Northwest Florida.

  With the recent closing of the American Family Planning Clinic, we recognized a need for a centralized support system for the area where people from any political background can take part in our shared goal.

  We are closely surrounded by states where abortion is not accessible so Pensacola is a vital point of contact.

  Our mission hinges on 3 points of focus:

    1. Political Action

    2. Cultural Change

    3. Local Access
