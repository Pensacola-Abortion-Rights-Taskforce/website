      PART serves Pensacola and the Gulf Coast by facilitating access to safe and affordable abortions, providing practical support, advocating for abortion rights, and educating and empowering communities. 
 
      PART is committed to reproductive justice. We believe that the decision to give birth and the decision to abort a pregnancy are both decisions that should be free from coercion, legal barriers, financial constraints, and stigma. To achieve reproductive justice, we must transform our culture and challenge oppression based on gender, race, sexual identity, and economic class, recognizing the complex ways that they intersect. 

      Abortion is healthcare, and healthcare is a human right.  PART supports and respects each individual’s right to control their own bodies and to make reproductive choices in their own best interests.
